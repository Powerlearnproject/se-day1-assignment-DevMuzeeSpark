#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

Software engineering is the process of using engineering tools, principles and method to develop and maintain high quality software system. 
The importance of software development involves the creation of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.

The key milestones in the evolution of software engineering are:
- The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s
- The advent of structured programming in the 1970s
- The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.

The phases of the software Development life cycle are:
- Requirements 
- Design
- Development
- Testing
- Deployment
- Maintenance
Explanation:
- Requirements: Here you gather the system requirements and what the user needs
- Design: Here you bring together the architecture and how you want teh user interface to be
- Development: This comes immediately after getting the architecture for your software, here you write the code and build the design as layout
- Testing: Here is ensuring it works according to as plan and as needed
- Deployment: This is teh phase where you release the software for usage by other users
- Maintenance: This is a future phase where you keep checking for possible addition or subtraction from the available software.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

Waterfall: Rigid, linear, minimal flexibility.
Agile: Flexible, iterative, continuous improvement.

**Appropriate Scenarios:**
Waterfall: Stable projects with fixed requirements.
Agile: Dynamic projects with evolving needs.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

Software Developer: Writing code and implementing software solutions
Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensure software quality by designing and executing test plans
Project Manager: To oversee the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.

The importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process is that:
IDEs are software suites that provide comprehensive tools for the writing, debugging, and testing of codes e.g VS code, Pycharm, Jupyter notebook
while
VCS are software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members e.g Git, subversion

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.

The major challenges faced are:
- Tight deadlines: The pressure to beat deadlines and deliver on time brings about rushed programming and compromised quality
- Technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.

Possible strategies to overcome challenges:
Effective communication
Agile methodologies (Flexibility in the sense)
Prioritization of task
Proper scheduling (from my perspective)


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.

The different types of testing in software quality assurance are:
- Unit testing: This involves testing individual modules of software
- Integration testing: Testing interaction between different subsystem
- System testing: Testing the entire system as a whole
- Acceptance testing: This is testing against user requirements if it meets the user's needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.

Prompt engineering is crafting clear and specific instructions (or prompts) to guide an AI model, to give the best possible answer. It's like asking a question in a way that makes sure you get the exact information you need.

**Importance**: 
When you ask a computer or AI a question, how you ask it matters. If the question is too vague or unclear, the computer might give you an answer that's not very helpful. But if you ask in a clear and specific way, you're more likely to get a useful and accurate response.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.

Example:
Vague Prompt: Tell me about animals.
Improved Prompt: Can you tell me about lions, including where they live, what they eat, and how they care for their young?

Why the Improved Prompt is More Effective: The improved prompt is more effective because it:
- Specifies the Animal: It asks about lions, not just any animal.
- Asks for Details: It asks for information about where lions live, what they eat, and how they care for their young.
- Clear and Concise: Itâ€™s easy to understand and focuses on getting specific information.
